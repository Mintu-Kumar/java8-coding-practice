/**
 * 1. Callable:
 * The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, but it can return a result (or throw an exception) when the task is completed. The Runnable interface, in contrast, does not allow returning a result and only defines the run() method, which is void.
 *
 * Callable tasks can be executed by a thread pool, and they return a Future object that can be used to retrieve the result of the computation.
 * Here's how Callable works in Java:
 *
 * Callable Interface has a method call() which returns a result (can throw exceptions too).
 *
 * Runnable has the run() method but doesnâ€™t return anything.
 *
 * 2. Future:
 * The Future interface represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It allows you to query the status of a task and retrieve its result once it's done.
 *
 * A Future object is returned when submitting a Callable to an executor.
 * The Future.get() method blocks until the result is available.
