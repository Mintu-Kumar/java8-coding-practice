1. What is thread pool in multithreading?
Ans - A thread pool in multithreading is a collection of worker threads that are used to perform tasks concurrently.
      The idea behind a thread pool is to manage and reuse threads rather than creating a new thread each time a task
      needs to be performed. This approach improves efficiency by minimizing the overhead associated with thread creation
      and destruction.  See -  Program - ThreadPoolExecutor.java
