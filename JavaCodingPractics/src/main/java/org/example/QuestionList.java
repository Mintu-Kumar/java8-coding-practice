     *
     * 1. Write a Java program for counting the digits present in a number.
     *
     * 2. A string is given. Our task is to write a Java program to toggle
     * the characters of the given string. For example, for the string "jaVaTpoiNt",
     *the string after the toggle will be "JAvAtPOInT".
     *
     * It is a well-known fact that strings are immutable in Java. Therefore, it
     * is required to create a new string. For toggling, we can use ASCII value, 'a'
     * can be converted to 'A' by 'A' = 'a' - 32.
     *
     *
     * 3.  Write a Java program for printing all of the unique characters present in a String.
     * For instance, for the string "pppdaf", print characters 'd', 'a', and 'f' since they are unique.
     * The character 'p' is coming thrice in the program. Hence, it is not printed. It is given only small
     * letters are present in the input string.
     *
     * 4. Print reverse array in Java using recursion for the given input array without using any
     * extra space. Ignore the implicit stack used in recursion for computing the space complexity.
     *
     * 5. Write a Java program to display the elements of the matrix in the Wave Order as mentioned below.
     * (The matrix can have different numbers of columns and rows).
